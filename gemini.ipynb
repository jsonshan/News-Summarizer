      "The old, leather-bound backpack felt heavy, even though it was empty. It sat on the dusty shelf in the attic, a forgotten relic from her grandfather. Eleven-year-old Lily had always been drawn to it, its worn straps and faded embroidery whispering of adventures past. \n",
      "\n",
      "One rainy afternoon, with nothing better to do, Lily brought the backpack downstairs. She brushed the dust off, admiring the intricate pattern woven into the leather – a swirling vine of ivy with a single, ruby-red leaf at its heart. As she ran her fingers along the leaf, a tingling sensation spread through her hand. The backpack vibrated, a faint humming sound filling the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "Curiosity bubbling, Lily slipped the straps over her shoulders. The moment it touched her back, a whirlwind of colors erupted in her mind – sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, bustling city streets. The backpack felt lighter, almost weightless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where do you want to go, Lily?” a voice whispered in her head. The voice was gentle, like the rustle of leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily, stunned, stammered, “I… I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then choose,” the voice urged, a hint of amusement in its tone. “The world awaits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily closed her eyes, picturing the places she’d dreamt of visiting. The Great Wall of China, with its ancient bricks reaching for the sky. The Amazon rainforest, teeming with life. The Northern Lights, dancing across the Arctic sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes snapped open. The room was gone. In its place, a vast expanse of blue ocean stretched before her, the warm sun on her face. She was on a white-sand beach, the smell of salt and seaweed filling her nostrils.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This… this is incredible!” Lily gasped, her eyes wide with wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backpack chuckled, a soft, melodious sound. “Welcome to the world, Lily. Where to next?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few weeks, the backpack became Lily’s portal to adventure. She climbed the Eiffel Tower, savored steaming bowls of ramen in Tokyo, and even rode a camel across the Sahara desert. Each experience was breathtaking, each location as vivid and real as the one before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with each new adventure, a nagging feeling grew in Lily's heart. She was living a life of pure escapism, ignoring her own world, her own family and friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "One day, she found herself standing in a bustling marketplace in Morocco, surrounded by colorful fabrics and the scent of spices. The backpack offered her a chance to fly across the Himalayas, but Lily hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I miss my home,\" she confessed to the backpack. \n",
      "\n",
      "The backpack, its voice no longer playful, said, \"Home is where your heart is, Lily. But your heart can only grow by experiencing the world.\"\n",

      "With a newfound purpose, Lily stepped back into her own world, her heart brimming with the memories of her adventures. She returned to her attic, the backpack resting comfortably on her back, ready for the next adventure. This time, she knew, it wouldn't be a magical escape, but a journey of self-discovery, fueled by the magic of the world, and the courage to explore it, one step at a time. \n",

(AP Photo/Ian Maule) Follow AP’s coverage of thepresidential election. LAS VEGAS (AP) — NevadaDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosenhas won reelection, beating Republican Sam Brown in atight but unusually quiet racefor the battleground state. The first-term senator had campaigned on abortion rights and positioned herself as a nonideological politician, a formula that also worked for the state’s senior senator, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, in her own reelection bid two years ago. “Thank you, Nevada! I’m honored and grateful to continue serving as your United States Senator,” Rosen said Friday on the social platform X. Brown, a retired Army captain who moved to Nevada from Texas in 2018 and has never held elected office, unsuccessfully tried to ride President-elect Donald Trump’s strong showing in the working-class state.Trump won Nevadaon Friday. The Associated Press left phone and emailed messages seeking comment Friday from Brown’s campaign. Just before Rosen won, Brown said on X that it was unacceptable that votes were still being counted in Nevada days after the election. “We deserve to know election results within hours, not a week later,” he said. Brown had Trump’s supportin the Republican primary and won easily, but he was significantly outspent during the campaign, leaving Rosen to dominate the airwaves for months. Rosen, a former Las Vegas-area synagogue president and computer programmer, ran ads touting herself as an independent who doesn’t listen to “party leaders.” Analysts note that Nevada has a history of backing no-nonsense senators who deliver funding from Washington. Rosen also spotlighted her work on expanding broadband internet access and helping to connectLas Vegas with Southern California via light rail. And she hammered Brown for his opposition to abortion rights, saying he would support a national abortion ban despite Brown’s statements that he respects Nevada voters’ choice decades ago to legalize abortions. Aballot measurethis year that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution passed. Voters must again approve it in 2026 in order to amend the constitution. The Senate contest drew relatively little national interest for most of the campaign, a striking contrast with the presidential race as both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris targeted the state and its six electoral votes. Conservative money flowed in during the final days as the GOP posted a strong showing in early period, but Brown was unable to fully fight back. Brown, who was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Afghanistan, was grievously wounded by an improvised explosive device there in 2008 and endured 30 surgeries as he recuperated. In campaign ads, he repeatedly mentioned that his face remains heavily scarred from the attack. He is also the founder of a medical company that serves veterans. Brown previously made an unsuccessful bid in 2022 for the Republican nomination to face Cortez Masto. All four ofNevada’s U.S. House incumbents— three Democrats and one Republican — also won reelection this year. Riccardi reported from Denver. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

      "CNN journalists were granted exclusive access to Cecot, El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum security prison built to house the country’s most dangerous gang members. The prison, opened in 2023, is a key part of President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown on gangs, which has dramatically reduced crime in El Salvador but drawn criticism from human rights groups. Cecot is designed to isolate inmates, with strict rules governing their daily routines and severely limited contact with the outside world. Inmates are kept in cells for 23.5 hours a day, denied access to books, letters, or even meat in their meals. They are subject to constant surveillance, and the prison itself is heavily fortified, with multiple layers of security, including electrified fences, watchtowers, and armed guards. \n",

      "Summary: \"Small Things Like These,\" a film starring Cillian Murphy, is based on Claire Keegan's Booker Prize-shortlisted novel about a coal merchant named Bill Furlong who confronts the oppressive power of the Catholic Church in 1980s Ireland. Inspired by his wife, Murphy collaborated with screenwriter Enda Walsh and director Tim Mielants to bring the story of the Magdalene laundries, workhouses where unmarried pregnant women were interned, to the screen. \n",
      "\n",
      "The film portrays Bill's journey as he witnesses the harsh realities of the laundry and discovers a young woman abandoned in the convent's coal shed. The film explores the complex moral dilemmas facing Bill, who is caught between the Church's influence and his own conscience. While the film depicts a dark period in Irish history, its themes of misogyny and abuse remain relevant, as evidenced by the recent government initiatives to address the legacy of mother and baby institutions. \n",

      "Summary: Drew Barrymore revealed on her talk show that her daughter and Adam Sandler's daughter recently watched their 2004 film \"50 First Dates\" together at Barrymore's house. This sparked a humorous exchange between the actress and her co-host Ross Mathews, with Barrymore jokingly questioning if her daughter needed more exposure to her and her co-star. The movie, which features Barrymore as a woman with short-term memory loss and Sandler as the man pursuing her, was originally titled \"50 First Kisses\" and had a much different ending, according to Barrymore.  The original ending was a more dramatic one, with Barrymore's character encouraging Sandler's character to move on and ultimately leaving him.  However, the ending was changed before filming, with Barrymore crediting Mathews for prompting the change to a happier ending. \n",
